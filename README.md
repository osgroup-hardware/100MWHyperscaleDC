# 100MWHyperscaleDC
Open Source state of the art Designs for a sustainable Hyperscale Data Center
***


- 100 MW total IT Capacity
- Super conductive DC power distribution ( we need to show the true PUE of AC/SC conversion and rectification, compared to Submer highlighting the PUE of fans inside the server.)
- DC central, scalable UPS
- ECOcooling equipment, with direct free cooling
- Heat reuse for liquid cooled equipment
- Infrastructure build from woods in segments
- active PUE reduction with PV energy production
- Direct integration of renewables (300 MW solar farm in 15 kms)
- Burst cooling, by Nitrogen
- Burst O2 reduction, by Nitrogen
- Natural Gas Backup Generator, fully integraded with the utility grid for frequency support
- Keymetrix: cost per kW, cost per sqm whitespace, real PUE
- Flexibility: OCP, 19" Mining equipment, Immersion and Liquid cooling
